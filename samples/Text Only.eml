Hello there! How are you guys?

We have arrived in Palm Bay, and this place is real vibey! To start off, my
new companion is Elder Smith, and he's a pretty chill dude. We found each
other at transfers, and then did the long ol' hour and a half drive out
here to the furthest reaches of our mission! I'm just glad we had a car and
didn't have to do that on a bus (my condolences to my other missionary
homies who are not so fortunate).

Neither Elder Smith nor I have ever been here before, so we're started from
ground zero as far as information. It also didn't help that out missionary
record system, Area Book, was down for the first two days of us being here.
=F0=9F=98=85 However, on those days, we just did some good ol' fashioned kn=
ocked
until out records came back, and we met this really nice guy who said he
could feel something special about The Book of Mormon!

We also met the ward here, and they are insanely hype. =F0=9F=98=8E=F0=9F=
=91=8D They absolutely
love missionary work, and they can't wait to help us out! It's going to be
awesome working with them! There's also a strong Young Single Adult (That's
YSA for those of y'all into that abbreviation thing) presence here. We've
been to institute with them and even went to an activity with them to watch
the devotional from President and Sister Oaks. It honesty felt kinda weird,
it was like, "Oh, people my own age - that exists, lol" Anyway, they're all
very cool, and some of them are even preparing for missions themselves!

Also, the beach culture is hilarious and mega chill, and I love it. =F0=9F=
=98=86 For
example, some of our YSA members had been out fishing for 9 hours in the
ocean (#metooifiwasntamissionary =F0=9F=A5=B2), and when talking about ways=
 to get
dates, one of them said, "Just giver her a crab" =F0=9F=A6=80=E2=9D=A4=EF=
=B8=8F=E2=80=8D=F0=9F=94=A5

As another side adventure:
Elder Smith had a baptism scheduled in his last area, and the girl there
really wanted him to baptize her. So, with permission from our mission
president, we hauled another hour and a half to make the journey. The
baptism was good, and the girl was so excited! It was cool to see more
people learning about the covenants of God, and feel the Spirit there.
Also, there was a three year old girl that crashed the photos and did a
little peace sign in all of them. =E2=9C=8C=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=98=82 Also, on t=
he way back we had to pick
something up from the Chuluota Elders, which longtime readers will remember
as my first-ever area! It was kinda trippy being back in the place where I
started being a missionary in the field...

Anywho...

=8F We got three more unusual spiders
on the board this week. They were all sharing a web, and they were black
with a glowing orange spot on their underside. Creepy. =F0=9F=91=8D

Mar Espiritual:
This verse comes from John 12:37. This was the last week of Jesus' life. He
had already done many miracles, taught amazing things, and showed His
mighty power to the Israelites. However, many of them still didn't believe:
"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not
on him." To me, this is just one more example of why miracles and signs
aren't what give us faith. I mean, this was Jesus; it was literally Him
among His people doing His work, but Satan was still able to confuse
people. This shows that we need to choose our faith. We know what we have.
We know what the prophets teach. Above all, we can have the witness of the
Spirit in our lives to guide us to our heavenly home. I'm so grateful for
modern prophets today, like the First Presidency. Elder Oaks spoak a lot
about big issues in our world today, and he gave inspired, prophetic
council on how to follow the Savior through these challenges. I still don't
know everything, and I don't even understand some of the things I do know,
but I know what the Spirit has confirmed to me. I have my faith, and
through that, miracles can be made manifest. I don't know where all of you
are spiritually, but wherever we're at in our journey, we can always choose
faith, and God will send us His power according to that faith.

Have a great week everyone, and I guess if you're into following beach
wisdom, stock up on crabs. =F0=9F=91=8D
